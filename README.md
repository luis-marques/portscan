# Portscan

Simple single-threaded TCP portscan in Python, created for educational purposes.

# Usage

Run the program and then enter the IPv4 address, or the domain name, of your target. You can then set which ports will be scanned. If you don't choose any port, it will test common TCP ports by default. At the end of the scan, the open ports are displayed.
